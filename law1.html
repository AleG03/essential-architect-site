        <h2>No tool can be more complicated than the action it performs</h2>
        <p class="law-desc">When designing and developing a system, balance the effort to implement the tool with the complexity of the action it must execute.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="law-content">
        <p>When we create solutions, the effort and complexity involved in implementing them should never exceed the complexity of the problem they're meant to solve.</p>
        <h3>Key Principles:</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Simplicity First:</strong> Always start with the simplest possible solution that could work. Complexity should only be added when clearly justified by requirements.</li>
          <li><strong>Cost-Benefit Balance:</strong> The time and resources invested in creating a tool should be proportional to the value it provides and the complexity of the task it performs.</li>
          <li><strong>Maintenance Consideration:</strong> Remember that complex tools require more maintenance, documentation, and training. This ongoing cost should be factored into the initial design decisions.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Practical Application:</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Before implementing a solution, assess whether the complexity of your proposed tool is justified by the problem it solves.</li>
          <li>Regularly review existing tools and systems to identify areas where simplification is possible.</li>
          <li>When faced with a complex problem, break it down into smaller, more manageable parts that can be solved with simpler tools.</li>
        </ul>
